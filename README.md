# PFSP

This is the research work about solving non-smooth Permutation Flow Shop Problem.

The implemented algorithms can be applied for solvation classic PFSP tasks.

### Implemented algorithms
1) classic NEH
2) NEH with sort rule based on 3 moments
3) Biased Randomised NEH with sort rule based on 3 momets
4) ILS
5) ILS with sort rule based on 3 moments
6) Biased Randomised ILS
7) Biased Randomised ILS with sort rule based on 3 momets
