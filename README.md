# PFSP

This repository is dedicated to research work about solving Permutation Flow Shop Problem.

To be honest, it's more for non-smooth Permutation Flow Shop Problem, but implemented algorithms can be used for solvation PFSP tasks.

### Implemented algorithms
1) classic NEH
2) NEH with sort rule based on 3 moments
3) Biased Randomised NEH with sort rule based on 3 momets
4) ILS
5) ILS with sort rule based on 3 moments
6) Biased Randomised ILS
7) Biased Randomised ILS with sort rule based on 3 momets
